Reddit wants to send AMC, GameStop stock to the moon. Here's how. 

Wall Street's big bets against GameStop were upended when users from a Reddit forum decided to bet on its success instead. Now billions of dollars are at stake.

For years, Wall Street investors have bet that struggling video game retailer GameStop would fail. The move toward online game buying would eventually spell doom, many thought. And the pandemic only seemed to make that worse. Wall Street was so sure GameStop would fail that they made it one of the most heavily bet-against stocks on the market. Over the past few months though, a bunch of Reddit users have been buying up shares, pushing up GameStop's value and undermining Wall Street's big bets. At first, these forum traders bought because they believed the company was better off than the Wall Street doubters thought. Then, as GameStop value soared, Wall Street's bad bets started to cost investors billions of dollars.  

Now the Reddit users want the price to rise even more, as they wage an epic battle against Wall Street. 

At one point, the Reddit users from the forum r/WallStreetBets sent the stock up more than 14,300% (you read that right), though it's gone through wild fluctuations. They've spread their strategy to struggling movie chain AMC, and tech company BlackBerry, too. In their wake, these online market players have upended Wall Street, creating a drama filled with memes, app trading disasters and weird internet lingo as big-time investors have lost billions of dollars. 

It's a crazy story, complete with cameos by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and CNBC financial commentator and former hedge fund manager Jim Cramer. There's even Michael Burry, one of the subjects of the book and movie The Big Short, who happens to be a prominent investor in GameStop.  

Even Silicon Valley found a way to get in the middle of this mess. It's wild. 

Despite the move being characterized as "insane" and a "Ponzi scheme," GameStop's stock has become the theater for a war between Wall Street and internet traders. Nearly everyone nearly all of them expecting it to fail. The questions are when, and who will be on the losing end when it does. 

"We're seeing a phenomenon that I have never seen," Jim Cramer, a Wall Street commentator on CNBC and a former hedge fund manager, said during a segment as GameStock's stock began rocketing up. And GameStop could be just the start. "It's insane." 

It all started last week, when posters on the Reddit stock trading chat community r/WallStreetBets pushed up shares in the struggling game retailer. With much of Wall Street betting against GameStop's success, r/WallStreetBets investors believed they could force a market rally by creating demand where there had been little before. 

As a result, GameStop stock jumped more than 822%, from $17.25 per share at the beginning of the year to a high of $159.18 on Monday. Then it dropped by nearly half, only to rise back up to $147.98 on Tuesday. And then Musk tweeted about it to his 43 million followers (using that weird internet vocabulary, of course), and the price jumped 40% in after-hours trading. On Wednesday, it closed at $347.51 per share, before dropping again in after-hours trading. 

On Thursday, it jumped even higher, to $483 per share, before halving again. Amid all the chaos, the New York Stock Exchange temporarily halted GameStop share trading more than a dozen times before midday Thursday. It ended the normal trading day down 44% to $193.60, only to jump back. 

The Reddit community has also turned its eyes on BlackBerry, attempting to pull the same trick. So far, they've pushed shares up more than double from $6.58 per share, where they started at the beginning of the year. On Tuesday, the stock closed at $18.92. On Wednesday, it closed regular trading at $25.10, though it's fallen since then to $14.65. 

There's also AMC. Reddit targeted that one, spawning the hashtag #SaveAMC on Twitter too. Its stock jumped from $2 per share last week to close trading at $19.90 on Wednesday. It too fell in after-hours trades, and after jumping on Thursday, fell again to close at $8.63. 

App-based traders Robinhood, TD Ameritrade and WeBull responded to the fluctuations by restricting trades of GameStop, AMC and other fast-moving stocks on their services. 

Robinhood drew particular ire, leading US Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as well as Sen. Ted Cruz, to criticize its decision. Some people had already raised concerns about Robinhood before, saying it "gamified" stock trading. Now it's being accused of outright market manipulation, including through at least one class action lawsuit filed already. Robinhood, for its part, said Friday that market rules effectively forced it to put those restrictions in place. 

It's a lot to take in. So, here's what you really need to know about GameStop, AMC and Wall Street. 

How'd this happen? 

Effectively, the r/WallStreetBets crowd realized Wall Street made a huge mistake. People known as short sellers who were betting GameStop stock would fall had been too aggressive.  

The r/WallStreetBets crowd understood that if they could create artificial demand for GameStop shares with their own money, they could force Wall Street to recalibrate its bets, pushing prices even higher. And some investors who couldn't even back up their bets against GameStop, would have to pay even more.  

As of Wednesday, there were 3.8 million members of the r/WallStreetBets community,  though it's nearly impossible to determine how many people are involved in the GameStop, AMC and BlackBerry schemes. 

What we do know is that all this activity appears to have created a "short squeeze," where the short sellers betting against GameStop are being forced to buy more GameStop stock to cover their losses. That pushed the price up even more, which forces more short sellers to cover their losses, which pushes the price up even more. Some of the Reddit crowd believe that GameStop stock could reach into the thousands of dollars just because of this mechanism. 

And that's why we're suddenly seeing GameStop's value jump.
